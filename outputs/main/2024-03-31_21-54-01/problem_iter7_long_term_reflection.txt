1. Normalize distances and weights for meaningful comparison.
2. Experiment with different weights and coefficients for trade-offs.
3. Simplify scoring formula and calculations for efficiency.
4. Use meaningful variable names and avoid hardcoding constants.
5. Explore alternative distance metrics and selection mechanisms to avoid local optima.
