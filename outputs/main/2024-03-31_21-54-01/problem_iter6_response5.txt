Explanation:
1. Renamed the variables to improve clarity and readability.
2. Calculate the distances between the current node and all unvisited nodes only once to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. Removed the lookahead score as it was not relevant to the problem.

This improved version takes into account the relationship between the current node's distance to the next node and the average distance to unvisited nodes. If the standard deviation of distances to unvisited nodes is above a threshold, it considers the distance from the destination node to the next node as well.
