In the `select_next_node_v2` function, I added a lookahead mechanism to improve decision-making. It considers a specified number of lookahead steps and evaluates the average and standard deviation of distances to the lookahead nodes. The function `find_lookahead_node` is responsible for finding the next lookahead node to consider.
