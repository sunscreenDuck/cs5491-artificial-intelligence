```python
def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
Explanation:
1. Removed unnecessary computations of average and standard deviation distance to unvisited nodes.
2. Simplified the objective function to focus on the distance from the current node to the unvisited nodes, and the distance from the destination node to the unvisited nodes.
3. Removed the look-ahead mechanism since it does not significantly improve the solution and only adds complexity.
