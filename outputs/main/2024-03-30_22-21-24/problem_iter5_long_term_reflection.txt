1. Simplify code and calculations, remove unnecessary components, experiment with different weights/parameters, and focus on key factors for better performance and readability.
2. Consider using meaningful variable names, normalizing distances, removing unnecessary calculations, and experimenting with weight combinations for optimized heuristic performance.
3. Incorporate the standard deviation of distances and consider additional factors or heuristics for more accurate decision-making in the weighted sum calculation.
