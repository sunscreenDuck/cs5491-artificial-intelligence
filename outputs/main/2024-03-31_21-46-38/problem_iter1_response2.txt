In `select_next_node_v2`, I added a look-ahead mechanism to consider the potential future benefits of choosing each unvisited node. The mechanism calculates a lookahead score for each unvisited node by estimating the score of choosing that node and then considering the score of choosing a subsequent node using a threshold factor. The lookahead score is added to the original score to give a more informed decision on which node to choose next.
