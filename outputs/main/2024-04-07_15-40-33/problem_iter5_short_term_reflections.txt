1. Normalize distance matrix by subtracting minimum and dividing by maximum.
2. Calculate row and column minimums separately, then subtract from normalized matrix.
3. Avoid unnecessary variable copies for improved efficiency.
4. Use numpy functions instead of manual calculations for cleaner and more readable code.
1. Normalize the distance matrix and subtract min from rows and columns.
2. Avoid copying the distance matrix and prevent self-loops.
1. Normalize distance matrix before calculating heuristics.
2. Subtract minimum values from rows and columns instead of full matrix.
- Normalize distances to a common scale and remove redundancy in calculating minimum distances.
- Consider the magnitude and range of the distances when designing the heuristics function.
1. Avoid normalizing the distance matrix and use column and row minimum subtraction.
2. Use element-wise operations instead of nested loops for efficiency.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations (e.g., normalization) unless they have a clear benefit.
- Simplify operations by minimizing unnecessary copying or extra steps.
- Use more efficient functions (e.g., np.fill_diagonal) when available.
1. Avoid double normalization and diagonal manipulations.
2. Use direct row and column minimum subtraction for better performance.
1. Normalize the distance matrix using a consistent approach.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each row and column separately.
3. Avoid setting diagonal elements to infinity unnecessarily.
1. Normalize distance matrix with the range (Max - Min), not just Max.
2. Subtract column and row minima to refine indicators' calculation.
1. Normalize distances for better comparison and scaling.
2. Use the same method to subtract minimum values from both rows and columns.
