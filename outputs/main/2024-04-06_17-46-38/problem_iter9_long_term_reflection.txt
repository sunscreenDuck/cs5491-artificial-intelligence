1. Prioritize factors that capture relevant characteristics of the problem and discard unnecessary calculations.
2. Normalize distance matrix for comparability and consider additional factors like standard deviation and pairwise differences.
3. Set appropriate thresholds and update heuristics values in-place for efficiency.
4. Balance weights and adapt heuristics to specific problem instances.
