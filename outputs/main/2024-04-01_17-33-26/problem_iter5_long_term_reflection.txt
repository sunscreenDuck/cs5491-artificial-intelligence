- Prioritize node-level information, normalize distances early, consider node degrees/neighborhoods, and explore adaptive approaches.
- Optimize computation, use penalty matrix instead of edge indicators, pre-calculate values, and employ vectorized operations.
- Consider node characteristics, weighted average distances, and alternative ways of calculating indicators for better performance.
