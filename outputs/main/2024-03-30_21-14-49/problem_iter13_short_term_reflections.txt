1. Consider simplifying the code logic and reducing the number of factors used.
2. Use constant weights and thresholds for simplicity and better performance.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations.
- Simplify code by removing unnecessary nested calculations.
- Use direct variable assignment instead of dictionary lookups.
- Remove unused variables.
- Minimize the number of operations in the score calculation.
1. Normalize weights for better impact. 
2. Consider using different weights for distance_to_node and distance_to_destination. 
3. Use meaningful variable names for better code readability.
1. Consider evaluating each node individually instead of calculating aggregated statistics.
2. Use min() instead of np.argmax() to select the next node.
3. Reconsider the weighting and scoring factors for a better balance.
4. Remove random noise from the scores to improve decision-making.
1. Consider using meaningful variable names for better readability.
2. Use the minimum instead of maximum to select the next node to visit.
- Simplify the weighting scheme and remove unnecessary calculations.
- Consider incorporating lookahead distances to make more informed decisions.
1. Consider using vectorized operations for improved performance.
2. Break down complex calculations into smaller steps for better readability and maintainability.
3. Remove random noise to ensure determinism of the heuristic.
4. Consider using a different aggregation method (e.g., max instead of min) for selecting the next node.
1. Simplify the weights and threshold used to calculate the score in the worse code version.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and data manipulations, as done in the better code version.
1. Consider simpler scoring factors and avoid unnecessary calculations.
2. Use a more efficient method to calculate scores and select next node.
1. Simplify the calculation of scores and remove unnecessary variables.
2. Remove lookahead_threshold and the related calculations, as it complicates the code without adding much value.
