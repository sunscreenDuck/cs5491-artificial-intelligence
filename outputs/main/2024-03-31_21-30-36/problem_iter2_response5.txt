In the improved code `select_next_node_v2`, I increased the number of lookahead steps to 5 to have a better evaluation of the heuristic search. I also modified the process of selecting a lookahead node by keeping track of a list of lookahead nodes. I removed the `lookahead_node` variable and replaced it with `lookahead_node[-1]` to get the last element in the list. Additionally, I modified the scoring function to include the sum of distances between the lookahead nodes. Finally, I updated the weights for the different components of the scoring function.

Reflection:
- Experiment with different numbers of lookahead steps to find the optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost.
- Further fine-tune the weights for the scoring function to achieve better performance.
- Consider using a random selection strategy to choose the lookahead node for more diverse exploration.
