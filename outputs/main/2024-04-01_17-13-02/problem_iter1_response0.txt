```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the average distance
    average_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix)
    
    # Normalize the distance matrix
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / average_distance
    
    # It's still bad to include long edges in the solution, but less bad than before
    return normalized_distance_matrix
