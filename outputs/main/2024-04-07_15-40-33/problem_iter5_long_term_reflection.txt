1. Normalize distance matrix by subtracting minimum and dividing by range for more effective heuristics.
2. Calculate row and column minimums separately, then subtract from normalized matrix to refine indicators' calculation.
3. Minimize unnecessary calculations and copying for improved efficiency.
4. Utilize numpy functions to simplify operations and improve code readability.
