1. Incorporate domain-specific factors and normalize values for fair comparison.
2. Simplify heuristics by reducing factors and assigning appropriate weights.
3. Consider non-linear relationships and remove unnecessary calculations.
4. Normalize distances and use dynamic thresholds for improved performance.
