1. Normalize distances and use meaningful variable names for better comparison and clarity.
2. Simplify weighting coefficients and calculations to reduce complexity.
3. Consider alternative distance metrics and set operations for efficiency and avoiding local optima.
4. Remove unnecessary calculations, consolidating repetitive code and removing redundant variables.
5. Experiment with various combinations of heuristics to find the most effective approach.
