1. Use min instead of max for selecting the next node.
2. Remove unnecessary calculation of the average look-ahead score in the worse code.
1. Remove redundant calculations outside the loop.
2. Avoid unnecessary look-ahead calculation unless it significantly improves the performance.
1. Consider including lookahead information in the scoring function.
2. Use arrays or lists to store lookahead scores instead of recalculating them multiple times.
3. Calculate average and standard deviation of the lookahead distances only once.
1. Consider incorporating a look-ahead mechanism to evaluate the impact of visiting each node.
2. Adjust the scoring weights and thresholds for better performance.
1. Simplify calculations and remove unnecessary variables and calculations.
2. Utilize look-ahead mechanism and consider the impact of visiting the next node.
3. Consider both average and standard deviation of distances to unvisited nodes.
4. Optimize by calculating distances between nodes only once.
1. Simplify calculations and remove unnecessary variables.
2. Consider alternative metrics to measure distances.
3. Explore different weighting factors for scoring algorithm.
4. Try different threshold values for look-ahead mechanism.
5. Investigate alternative methods to calculate look-ahead score.
1. Remove unnecessary code (e.g., threshold) to simplify the heuristic.
2. Eliminate the unnecessary lookahead score calculation to improve performance.
3. Use a simpler scoring function with fewer parameters for better readability.
4. Consider incorporating additional information (e.g., nearest neighbor or local search).
5. Explore different selection strategies (e.g., random selection, probabilistic selection).
- Consider incorporating look-ahead mechanisms to evaluate the impact of selecting different nodes.
- Use a dynamic threshold based on the current score to determine whether to perform look-ahead evaluations.
1. Consider incorporating a look-ahead mechanism to improve decision-making based on future node selections.
2. Use a threshold to selectively apply the look-ahead mechanism to nodes with higher scores.
1. Avoid redundant computations and reuse intermediate results.
2. Consider lookahead distances instead of individually calculating look_ahead_score for each node.
