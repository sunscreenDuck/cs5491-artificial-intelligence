1. Avoid unnecessary centering and scaling for improved heuristic performance.
2. Normalize the distance matrix and subtract minimum values for better indicator calculation.
1. Normalize distance matrix and calculate intermediate variables for better performance.
2. Use intermediate variables for calculating heuristics rather than manipulating the distance matrix directly.
Centering the matrix is unnecessary and can be avoided for better performance.
1. Avoid unnecessary intermediate variables and computations.
2. Perform computations in place to save memory and improve efficiency.
Avoid modifying the input matrix directly, create a copy instead.
Separate normalization and minimum subtraction steps for better code clarity.
Hint 1: Normalize the distance matrix to improve the heuristics function.

Hint 2: Compute row and column minimums for better heuristics calculation.
- Avoid unnecessary copying and use direct references.
- Eliminate unnecessary intermediate variables.
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations and scaling.
2. Utilize minimum values instead of mean values for better centering and normalization.
1. Use np.copy() for in-place modification.
2. Normalize input before applying other transformations.
3. Account for both row and column minimums when subtracting from the distance matrix.
Normalize distances, subtract min row and column in separate steps for better performance.
