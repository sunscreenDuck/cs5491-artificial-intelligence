1. Simplify code structure and eliminate redundancy for improved readability and performance.
2. Optimize computations by using efficient data structures and avoiding unnecessary calculations.
3. Fine-tune weights and thresholds, considering factors like lookahead and standard deviation.
4. Incorporate relevant factors and a lookahead mechanism to improve decision-making.
5. Focus on the objective function and consider local neighborhood rather than global statistics.
