```python
def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    threshold = 0.7
    weights = np.array([0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1])

    scores = {}
    
    neighbors = unvisited_nodes.copy()
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbors |= set(np.argsort(distance_matrix[node])[:3])  # Explore 3 nearest neighbors of each node
    
    for node in neighbors:
        unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - {node})]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(unvisited_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(unvisited_distances)

        # Calculate score using weighted sum
        score = np.dot(weights, np.array([
            distance_matrix[current_node, node],
            -average_distance_to_unvisited,
            std_dev_distance_to_unvisited,
            -distance_matrix[destination_node, node]
        ]))

        if std_dev_distance_to_unvisited <= threshold:
            score *= -1

        scores[node] = score

    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
The improved code explores the 3 nearest neighbors of each unvisited node in addition to the unvisited nodes themselves, which can potentially lead to finding better solutions. The score calculation and weighting remain the same.
