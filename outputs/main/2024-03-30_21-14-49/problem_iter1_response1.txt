In `select_next_node_v2`, I have added a look-ahead mechanism. It considers the potential distance to the next node and the final destination node while calculating the score. The look-ahead mechanism adds a weight of `threshold` to the look-ahead distance.

I have also calculated the average distance and standard deviation of the look-ahead distances, and incorporated them into the score calculation.

You can now use the `select_next_node_v2` function to perform TSP optimizations with improved look-ahead mechanisms.
