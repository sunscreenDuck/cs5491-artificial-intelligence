1. Normalize distances and use meaningful variable names to improve clarity and balance weights.
2. Utilize numpy operations and avoid unnecessary calculations to optimize computation and improve efficiency.
3. Consider domain knowledge and tune weights using experimental evaluation to achieve better results.
4. Simplify the scoring function by reducing the number of weights and terms, and consider both exploration and exploitation aspects.
