1. Simplify scoring function, adjust weights, and avoid redundant calculations for better performance.
2. Use set operations, local variables, and eliminate unnecessary calculations to optimize efficiency.
3. Consider problem-specific insights, factors, constraints, and adjustable parameters for improved heuristics.
4. Use meaningful variable names, numpy arrays, and minimize code duplication for better code clarity and flexibility.
