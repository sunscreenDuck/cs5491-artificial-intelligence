1. Normalize distance values before applying heuristics.
2. Combine factors in a way that captures both local and global information.
3. Set threshold based on the problem characteristics.
1. Consider additional factors such as maximum distance and average pairwise difference between distances.
2. Incorporate average distance to closest neighbors to improve the heuristic quality.
3. Consider relative differences and ratios instead of absolute values.
1. Normalize distance values before combining them in the heuristics function.
2. Use a threshold based on the average distance to filter out unpromising elements.
1. Consider normalizing distance values based on the problem domain instead of mean and standard deviation.
2. Prioritize relevant factors and simplify the combination for calculating heuristics.
1. Consider incorporating more factors that capture different aspects of the problem.
