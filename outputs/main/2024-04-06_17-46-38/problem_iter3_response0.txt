def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    pairwise_diff = np.mean(np.abs(np.diff(distance_matrix[np.nonzero(distance_matrix)])))
    
    # Calculate the average distance to closest neighbors
    min_distances = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    avg_min_distance = np.mean(min_distances)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            # Calculate the heuristics value as a combination of factors
            heuristic_value = 1 / distance_matrix[i, j] + average_distance / distance_matrix[i, j]**2 + distance_matrix[i, j] / max_distance + \
                              (avg_min_distance - distance_matrix[i,j]) / avg_min_distance + \
                              (distance_matrix[i,j] - min_distances[i]) / pairwise_diff
            
            # Set the threshold based on the average distance
            threshold = average_distance / max_distance

            # Set unpromising elements to zero
            if heuristic_value < threshold:
                heuristic_value = 0
            
            heuristics[i, j] = heuristic_value
    
    return heuristics
```
Note: The `heuristics_v2` function incorporates an adaptive thresholding technique based on the average distance. This helps in sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero, resulting in a more efficient optimization process.
