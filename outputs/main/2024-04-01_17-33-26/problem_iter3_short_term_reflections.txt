- Consider individual node properties rather than global statistics.
- Normalize values based on node characteristics rather than overall averages.
- Consider using weighted average instead of shortest edge for edge heuristics.
- Normalize the distances by node averages for better performance.
1. Consider using global information rather than local information.
2. Normalize the indicators to make them comparable across different instances.
1. Consider using node-level information rather than global statistics.
2. Normalize distances using node averages rather than global averages.
1. Consider normalizing the distance matrix to obtain better heuristics values.
2. Scale the indicators appropriately to avoid overflows and underflows.
3. Explore different normalization techniques to improve the quality of the heuristics.
4. Incorporate domain-specific knowledge to enhance the heuristics' performance.
1. Prioritize edges based on their relative distances to the average distances of their connected nodes.
2. Avoid normalizing distances to prevent edge cases with small ranges having high heuristics values.
1. Consider the range of distances to normalize heuristics values instead of the average and standard deviation.
2. Normalize distances between 0 and 1 instead of using their average and standard deviation.
Consider using local search instead of prior indicators, and use node-based calculations for better performance.
1. Prioritize edges with smallest differences, rather than normalizing distances.
2. Calculate edge heuristics based on the shortest edge for each node.
- Use a range-based heuristics function to assign higher values to better edges.
- Normalize distance values to balance edge selection while avoiding division by zero.
