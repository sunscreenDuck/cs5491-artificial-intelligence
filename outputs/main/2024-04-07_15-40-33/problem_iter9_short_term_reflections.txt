Hints for designing better heuristics:
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations.
2. Normalize and subtract minimum values efficiently.
1. Keep the original distance matrix for calculations.
2. Normalize the matrix after creating a copy.
3. Subtract the minimum values from rows and columns in the original matrix.
1. Normalize the distance matrix using the maximum distance.
2. Subtract the minimum values from each row and column.
1. Normalize using range method: (distance_matrix - np.min(distance_matrix)) / (np.max(distance_matrix) - np.min(distance_matrix))

2. Precompute minimums outside loop: Move min_row and min_col computations outside the loop to improve performance.
1. Normalize distance matrix based on the maximum value instead of range.
2. Calculate minimum values for rows and columns directly from the original distance matrix.
- Avoid unnecessary variable assignments.
- Use consistent variable names for clarity.
- Normalize the distance matrix before calculating row and column minimums.
1. Normalize by dividing by matrix maximum.
2. Subtract row and column minimum simultaneously.
- Normalize distance matrix before centering.
- Subtract minimum from each row and column after normalization.
1. Remove unnecessary normalization step.
2. Calculate minimum row and column values only once.
- Normalize distance matrix using division and find minimum values before subtraction.
- Subtract minimum values only once from the distance matrix.
