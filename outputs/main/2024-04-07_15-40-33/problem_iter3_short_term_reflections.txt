- Consider removing unnecessary loops and calculations.
- Utilize matrix operations for faster computation.
- Eliminate the need for nested loops by using broadcasting operations.
- Preprocess the distance matrix to remove constraints (e.g., set diagonal elements to infinity).
- Normalize the distance matrix before applying heuristics.
1. Avoid using average distance as an indicator.
2. Consider subtracting column/row minimums to modify the distance matrix.
1. Normalize distances based on the average distance.
2. Remove self-loops and normalize distances based on row and column minimums.
1. Consider incorporating statistical measures for better heuristics.
2. Explore the use of deviation and standard deviation to compute badness score.
1. Normalize distances for each edge before calculating deviation.
2. Remove redundant calculations and in-place modifications for performance improvement.
- Normalize the distance values to have a common scale.
- Assign a higher badness value to the edges with high relative distances.
1. Normalize indicator values to avoid bias on distance distribution.
2. Subtract row and column minimums to account for individual node distances.
- Normalize the distance matrix.
- Subtract the minimum value from each row and column.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations and iterations.
- Utilize numpy functions for better performance and concise code.
- Normalize distances using the min-max normalization for more meaningful indicators.
1. Consider using a normalization approach to improve the effectiveness of the heuristics.
2. Look for indicators directly related to the problem to efficiently guide the local search.
