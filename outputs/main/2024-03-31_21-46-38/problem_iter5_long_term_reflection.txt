- Use meaningful variable names for code readability and simplify calculations by eliminating unnecessary steps.
- Adjust weights and thresholds, and consider the impact of multiple future nodes for a better scoring function.
- Minimize redundant computations and optimize efficiency for improved performance.
- Incorporate additional factors and constraints, and explore alternative scoring methods or heuristics.
