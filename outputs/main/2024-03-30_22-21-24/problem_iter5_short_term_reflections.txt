- Reduce the number of features used for scoring in the first code.
- Simplify the scoring formula in the second code.
- Avoid unnecessary normalizations, especially if they don't have any significant impact on the final result.
- Simplify the weighting scheme by using fewer weights and eliminating unnecessary factors.
1. Consider using constants (c1, c2, c3, c4) for weighting factors to adjust the impact of different variables.
2. Calculate average and standard deviation of all distances instead of only distances to other unvisited nodes.
1. Consider using more descriptive variable names for better readability.
2. Normalize the scores to ensure fairness in weighted sum calculations.
3. Remove unnecessary variables and calculations for better efficiency.
4. Experiment with different weights and constants for optimized heuristic performance.
5. Consider incorporating additional factors or heuristics for more accurate decision-making.
1. Consider incorporating the standard deviation of distances for better performance.
2. Experiment with different weight values to find the optimal combination.
1. Consider using meaningful variable names and avoiding unnecessary calculations.
2. Experiment with different weight combinations to find the best performance.
1. Normalize the distances in the better code to make them comparable.
2. Use optimized values for coefficients c1, c2, c3, and c4 in the better code.
1. Normalize weights by sum in [Better code].
2. Consider removing outliers when calculating average and standard deviation.
3. Consider other node selection strategies like roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.
1. Consider incorporating both the average distance and standard deviation to balance exploration and exploitation.
2. Use set operations to simplify code and improve efficiency.
3. Adjust coefficients to reflect the relative importance of different factors.
1. Consider using additional information like standard deviation of distances in heuristics.
2. Consider a finer tuning of the weights/coefficients in the heuristics.
