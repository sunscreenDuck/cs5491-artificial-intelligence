1. Use a threshold-based approach for better performance.
2. Use a list of weights instead of individual weights for better code clarity and flexibility.
3. Use set operations to simplify code logic and increase efficiency.
4. Use local variables for intermediate calculations to avoid repeated computations.
1. Consider distances from current node, not to current node. 
2. Only consider distances to unvisited nodes, not all nodes. 
3. Use np.mean and np.std to calculate average and standard deviation.
4. Use relevant coefficients for scoring function.
5. Use np.random.choice for diversification when the threshold is not met.
1. Instead of using a fixed threshold, calculate weights based on problem-specific properties.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly accessing the required distances. 
3. Remove numpy dependency for better performance.
4. Make the code more readable by using appropriate variable names and breaking down complex expressions.
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations and variables.
2. Use a consistent and meaningful naming convention for variables.
3. Simplify computations by using a list instead of multiple variables.
4. Minimize code duplication and ensure code readability by using the same variable names.
5. Consider using a consistent randomization approach for selecting the next node.
1. Consider the weights of different factors carefully for a better score calculation.
2. Use descriptive variable names for better code readability and understanding.
3. Avoid unnecessary calculations or data manipulations in the loop for improved efficiency.
4. Use a more deterministic approach for selecting the next node instead of utilizing a random choice.
5. Analyze the impact of each factor and their combinations for potential improvements.
1. Normalize the weights in the better code version.
2. Consider the inclusion of additional variables in the scoring function in the better code version.
1. Define and use separate variables for weights in the better code version.
2. Compute average and standard deviation inside the loop for better accuracy.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Reuse intermediate calculations within the loop.
- Consider the impact of parameter values on the heuristic's performance.
1. Consider using meaningful variable names for better code readability.
2. Avoid hardcoding weights and use a dictionary for better flexibility and maintainability.
3. Calculate distance to destination node using a combination of distances to current and destination nodes.
4. Pre-calculate distance matrix and use appropriate indexing for better efficiency.
5. Consider additional factors or weights to improve the effectiveness of the heuristic.
1. Use numpy functions for calculations instead of loops.
2. Use lists instead of dictionaries for weights.
3. Use set operations instead of list slicing.
4. Reduce the number of intermediate variables used.
5. Simplify the formula for calculating the score.
6. Remove unnecessary operations, like calculating distance to destination for every unvisited node.
