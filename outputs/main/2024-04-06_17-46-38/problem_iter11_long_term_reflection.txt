1. Consider normalizing distance values and incorporating diverse factors.
2. Use problem-specific knowledge to tailor heuristics.
3. Experiment with combinations and weights of factors.
4. Optimize heuristics for scalability and computational efficiency.
5. Validate heuristics on various problem instances for effectiveness.
