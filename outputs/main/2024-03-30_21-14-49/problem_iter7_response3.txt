```python

    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    
    scores = {}
    
    avg_distances = np.mean(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)].T[:, list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=0)
    std_dev_distances = np.std(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)].T[:, list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=0)
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * avg_distances[node] + c3 * std_dev_distances[node] - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]

I have made optimizations to the code based on various aspects mentioned in the prior reflection.

1. Removed the threshold variable as it wasn't used in the code.
2. Simplified the code structure by removing redundant calculations.
3. Used numpy operations to efficiently calculate the average and standard deviation of distances to unvisited nodes.
4. Removed the iteration over unvisited nodes to calculate average and standard deviation distances to unvisited nodes, and instead used numpy operations to calculate these values directly.
5. Replaced the calculation of `average_distance_to_unvisited` and `std_dev_distance_to_unvisited` with `avg_distances[node]` and `std_dev_distances[node]` respectively.
6. Removed unnecessary type annotations for improved readability.

This mutated code should have improved performance and readability compared to the original version.
