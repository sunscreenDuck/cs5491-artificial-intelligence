1. Use lookahead mechanisms to improve node selection.
2. Simplify code by removing unnecessary variables and calculations.
3. Utilize numpy functions instead of list comprehension for efficiency.
4. Consider larger lookahead and smaller threshold values for improved performance.
5. Optimize distance matrix calculations with data structures or caching.
