```python

    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""

    weights = {'distance_to_current': 0.4, 'average_distance_to_unvisited': 0.3, 'std_dev_distance_to_unvisited': 0.2, 'distance_to_destination': 0.1}

    for node in unvisited_nodes:

        # Calculate the distances to other unvisited nodes and their average and standard deviation
        distances_to_unvisited = distance_matrix[node][list(unvisited_nodes - {node})]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(distances_to_unvisited)

        score = weights['distance_to_current'] * distance_to_current \

        # Check if the current node has a better score than the previous best node
        if score < best_score:

```
In the improved `select_next_node_v2` function, I made the following changes:
1. Used meaningful variable names to improve code readability and understandability.
2. Removed the unnecessary calculation of distances inside the loop, as they can be pre-calculated before the loop.
3. Replaced the usage of the `scores` dictionary with the `best_node` and `best_score` variables to keep track of the node with the best score.
4. Added comments to explain the purpose of each calculation and step in the function.
