```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges in the solution
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    return max_distance - distance_matrix
```
The `heuristics_v2` function improves upon `heuristics_v1` by calculating the difference between the maximum distance in the distance matrix and each distance value in the matrix. This indicates how bad it is to include each edge in the solution, with longer edges having higher values.
