1. Simplify code structure, optimize computations, and focus on the objective function for improved performance.
2. Include statistical measures and consider the impact of standard deviation to make better decisions.
3. Incorporate factors like distance to destination and experiment with weighted sum to improve scoring and decision-making.
4. Use meaningful variable names, avoid unnecessary calculations, and explore nearby nodes for better solutions.
