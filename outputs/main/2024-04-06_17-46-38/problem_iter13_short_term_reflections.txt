1. Incorporate more informative factors (e.g., standard deviation, pairwise difference) in the heuristic calculation.
2. Balance the weight of different factors to reflect their relative importance.
3. Consider properties of the TSP problem (e.g., average distance, minimum distances) in the heuristics calculation.
4. Normalize the distance matrix appropriately for effective comparison and weighting.
1. Focus on meaningful factors for heuristic calculations.
2. Consider normalization and other statistical measures for better heuristic performance.
1. Normalize the distance matrix before calculating heuristics.
2. Consider average distance, maximum distance, standard deviation, pairwise differences, and nearest neighbors. 
3. Set unpromising elements to zero.
1. Consider using a weighted combination of different factors in the heuristics. 
2. Normalize the distance matrix to improve the generalizability of the heuristics.
3. Use meaningful statistics like average distance, standard deviation, and pairwise differences in distances.
4. Incorporate factors like average distance to closest neighbors and maximum distance into the heuristics.
5. Set a threshold to identify unpromising elements and disregard them in the heuristics calculation.
1. Consider incorporating more factors that capture different characteristics of the problem instance.
2. Normalize the factors properly to ensure fair weighting and meaningful comparisons.
3. Set appropriate thresholds to filter out unpromising elements, but avoid overly aggressive pruning.
4. Prioritize factors that have a stronger impact on the heuristic value.
5. Test and fine-tune the heuristics based on the specific characteristics of the TSP problem instances.
- Normalize distance matrix and use average, standard deviation, and pairwise difference as factors.
- Use average distance to set threshold and include factors that consider distance to closest neighbors.
- Consider incorporating additional factors, such as distance variance or edge uniqueness.
- Ensure that heuristics capture both local and global information of the problem.
- Experiment with different combinations of factors to find the most effective ones.
