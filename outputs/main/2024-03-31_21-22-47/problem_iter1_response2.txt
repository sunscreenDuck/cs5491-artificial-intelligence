```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes with look-ahead mechanisms."""
    threshold = 0.7
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        all_distances = [distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(all_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)

        look_ahead_scores = []
        for next_node in unvisited_nodes:
            if next_node != node:
                next_distances = [distance_matrix[next_node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != next_node]
                next_average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(next_distances)
                next_std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(next_distances)

                look_ahead_score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node] + threshold * (c1 * distance_matrix[node][next_node] - c2 * next_average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * next_std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][next_node])
                look_ahead_scores.append(look_ahead_score)

        score = max(look_ahead_scores)
        scores[node] = score
    
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
In the improved version, I have added a look-ahead mechanism where I calculate a look-ahead score for each unvisited node. The look-ahead score takes into account the potential next node to be visited. The final score is the maximum look-ahead score among all possible next nodes.
