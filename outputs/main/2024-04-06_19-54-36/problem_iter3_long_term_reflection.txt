1. Simplify calculations, use meaningful variable names, and combine factors directly.
2. Revisit average distance for edge importance and adjust sparsification threshold for better pruning.
3. Utilize multiple factors, handle edge cases, and adjust sparsification threshold for trade-off.
4. Incorporate average and minimum distances, use combined factor for sparsification, and adjust threshold.
5. Combine factors from distance matrices, choose more meaningful sparsification threshold.
6. Exploit informative features, incorporate domain-specific knowledge, explore different algorithms, and evaluate heuristics using benchmarks.
7. Normalize distance matrix, consider additional factors (local search, clustering), and calculate inverse distances.
8. Use sum of inverse distances, sparsify matrix, weight factors appropriately, and consider inverse degree.
