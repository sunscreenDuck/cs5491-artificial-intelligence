In the `heuristics_v2` function, I have considered different normalization techniques for calculating the average distance, maximum distance, standard deviation of the distance, average pairwise difference between distances, and average distance to closest neighbors. I have also optimized the code by using vectorized operations for calculating these factors. Additionally, I have added adaptive thresholding to set unpromising elements to zero.
