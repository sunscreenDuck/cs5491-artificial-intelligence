1. Simplify scoring function and remove redundant calculations.
2. Consider impact of future nodes, adjust weights and thresholds.
3. Use meaningful variable names, optimize efficiency, and explore alternative scoring methods.
4. Consider additional factors, constraints, and problem-specific insights.
5. Use adjustable parameters, numpy arrays, and minimize redundant computations.
6. Choose appropriate variables, rethink calculations, and optimize performance.
