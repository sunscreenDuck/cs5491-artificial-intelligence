System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to give hints to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two heuristics functions for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via guided local search. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how bad it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]
    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    max_dist = np.max(distance_matrix)
    min_dist = np.min(distance_matrix)
    
    # Initialize the indicator matrix
    indicators = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the mean distance and standard deviation
    mean_dist = np.mean(distance_matrix)
    std_dist = np.std(distance_matrix)
    
    # Assign indicators based on the distance from the mean
    indicators[distance_matrix > mean_dist] = -1
    indicators[distance_matrix < mean_dist] = 1
    
    # Normalize the indicators to the range [-1, 1]
    indicators = (indicators - np.min(indicators)) / (np.max(indicators) - np.min(indicators))
    
    # Scale the indicators based on the standard deviation
    indicators = indicators * std_dist
    
    # Assign very negative indicators to long edges
    indicators[distance_matrix > max_dist / 2] = -1000
    
    return indicators

[Better code]

    # Calculate the average distance
    average_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix)
    
    # Normalize the distance matrix
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / average_distance
    
    # It's still bad to include long edges in the solution, but less bad than before
    return normalized_distance_matrix

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to give hints to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via guided local search. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.


Below are some newly gained insights.
1. Use normalized distance matrix instead of arbitrary indicators.
2. Give less penalty to long edges to prevent early convergence.
1. Consider normalizing distance metric more effectively.
2. Prioritize penalizing long edges over normalizing distance matrix.
- Consider using more meaningful indicators for edge selection.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations and matrix transformations.
- Update the distance matrix directly based on the heuristics.
1. Normalize distances between [0, 1] and use shortest path to determine priorities.
2. Prioritize lower distances and reduce the influence of outliers.
1. Normalize distances to give equal importance to all edges.
2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find shortest path.
3. Prioritize edges based on their distance from the optimal path.
1. Focus on the problem-specific characteristics instead of general statistical properties.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and transformations.
3. Keep the indicator values consistent with the problem requirements.
4. Simplify the heuristic by directly using the problem data.
1. Consider using a more sophisticated normalization technique to balance the impact of different distances.
2. Use a heuristics value that takes into account both the maximum and minimum distances in the distance matrix.
1. Incorporate domain knowledge in heuristics.
2. Focus on the problem-specific characteristics.
3. Simpler heuristics can sometimes be more effective.
1. Scaling distance matrix: Normalize by dividing each element by mean or average distance.
2. Weighted penalization: Apply exponential function to penalize long edges more heavily for better search.
1. Consider incorporating distance matrix statistics to guide the heuristic calculations.
2. Identify and amplify indicators that deviate significantly from the average distance.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

User Prompt: 
Write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via guided local search. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how bad it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.


[Prior reflection]
1. Utilize problem-specific knowledge and characteristics to simplify and improve the heuristic.
2. Balance the impact of different distances through more sophisticated normalization techniques or weighted penalization.
3. Consider incorporating distance matrix statistics to guide the heuristic calculations and prioritize edge selection.
