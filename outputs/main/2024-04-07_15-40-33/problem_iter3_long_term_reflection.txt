1. Use matrix operations and broadcasting to eliminate nested loops and improve computation efficiency.
2. Preprocess the distance matrix to remove constraints and normalize distances for more effective heuristics.
3. Incorporate statistical measures like deviation and standard deviation to compute badness scores for better heuristics.
4. Utilize numpy functions and minimize unnecessary calculations for improved performance and concise code.
