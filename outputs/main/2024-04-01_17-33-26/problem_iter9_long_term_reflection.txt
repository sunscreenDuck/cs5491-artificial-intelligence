1. Use global statistics to normalize distances and prioritize simplicity in the calculation.
2. Optimize computation with vectorized operations and consider using penalty matrices based on normalized distance matrix.
3. Explore different normalization techniques and consider using more representative measures of node distances.
4. Consider using the sum instead of the average for better heuristics and minimize unnecessary calculations.
