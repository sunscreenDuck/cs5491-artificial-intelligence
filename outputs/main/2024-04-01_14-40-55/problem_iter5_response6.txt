```
I made the following improvements to the code:
1. Changed the name of the function to `select_next_node_v2`.
2. Simplified the code by removing unnecessary variables.
3. Optimized the loop by directly calculating the scores without building a list of lookahead scores if there are any.
4. Handled the case when there are no lookahead scores, avoiding division by zero error.
5. Made the code more readable and improved variable naming.
