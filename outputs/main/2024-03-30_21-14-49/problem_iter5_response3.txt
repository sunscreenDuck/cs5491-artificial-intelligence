    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""

        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)

        distances[node] = (average_distance_to_unvisited, std_dev_distance_to_unvisited)

        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score

    lookahead_scores = {}

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        lookahead_score = np.mean([scores[neighbor] for neighbor in unvisited_nodes if neighbor != node])

    next_node = min(lookahead_scores, key=lookahead_scores.get)

    return next_node
```
In this updated `select_next_node_v2` function, I have introduced a dictionary `distances` to store the average distance and standard deviation for each unvisited node. This eliminates the need to calculate these values multiple times when assessing the score for each node.

Additionally, I have introduced a lookahead mechanism to further improve decision-making. The lookahead score calculates the average score of the neighboring nodes, including the current node, which allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of each node's potential.

Finally, the function returns the node with the minimum lookahead score as the next node to visit.
