```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Calculate the sum of distances for each node
    node_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the average distance for each node
    node_avg_distance = node_distances / (num_nodes - 1)
    
    # Initialize the penalty matrix with zeros
    penalty_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)
    
    # Compute the penalty values using vectorized operations
    penalty_matrix = distance_matrix / (node_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] + node_avg_distance)
    
    return penalty_matrix
```
In the improved code:
- The average distances are computed only once to avoid unnecessary computation.
- Vectorized operations are used to compute the penalty values, making the code more efficient.
- The penalty matrix is initialized as zeros and then updated directly, eliminating the need for nested loops.
