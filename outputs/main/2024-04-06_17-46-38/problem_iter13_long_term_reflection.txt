1. Balance and prioritize factors based on problem-specific knowledge.
2. Experiment with effective combinations of factors and their weights.
3. Normalize distance matrix and consider average, standard deviation, pairwise difference, and distance to closest neighbors.
4. Use thresholds to filter out unpromising elements strategically.
