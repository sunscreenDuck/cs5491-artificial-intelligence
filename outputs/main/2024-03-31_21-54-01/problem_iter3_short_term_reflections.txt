- Consider using a more meaningful threshold value that is based on problem-specific characteristics.
- Explore alternative scoring mechanisms that better capture the problem structure and goals.
1. Consider using a min-heap to efficiently retrieve the node with the highest score.
2. Instead of using a fixed threshold, dynamically determine the threshold based on the problem instance.
3. Consider incorporating additional factors, such as node degree or adjacency to improve the heuristic.
4. Prioritize exploring promising options early instead of calculating all possible lookahead scores.
