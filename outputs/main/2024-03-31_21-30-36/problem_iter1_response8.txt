        lookahead_scores = lookahead_scores[:num_lookaheads]

        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]

```
Note: I have added look-ahead mechanisms in the `select_next_node_v2` function. The function calculates the score not only based on the current step but also considers the potential scores in the future look-ahead steps. The `threshold` parameter controls the number of look-ahead steps considered, and the function selects the node with the highest overall score.
