1. Simplify code and calculations, remove unnecessary components, and experiment with different weights and parameters.
2. Focus on key factors, prioritize code readability, and consider alternative scoring methods and selection strategies.
3. Remove unnecessary calculations, variables, and thresholds for efficiency and simplicity.
4. Experiment with different weights, explore alternative scoring functions, and simplify computation for better performance.
5. Consider removing the lookahead feature, normalize distances, and introduce additional parameters to control scoring equation.
