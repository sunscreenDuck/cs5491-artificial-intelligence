1. Consider the use of domain-specific knowledge to determine the sparsification threshold.
2. Apply sparsification by setting elements less than the threshold to zero.
1. Avoid unnecessary calculations and operations in the heuristic function.
2. Use intermediate variables to store values that are reused multiple times.
3. Optimize operations such as subtraction and division, and minimize function calls.
1. Avoid redundant calculations (e.g., calculating mean and standard deviation multiple times).
2. Simplify the code by removing unnecessary intermediate variables (e.g., normalized_inverse_matrix).
3. Consider alternative sparsification thresholds (e.g., using a fraction of the mean or standard deviation).
1. Normalize before inverse operation.
2. Calculate mean and standard deviation after inverse operation.
3. Determine threshold based on statistical measures and domain-specific knowledge.
4. Efficiently apply sparsification to reduce computation.
- Normalize the distance matrix before applying any other calculations.
- Consider using the maximum value of the distance matrix for normalization.
1. Consider utilizing domain-specific knowledge when determining threshold for sparsification.
2. Use a refined threshold for sparsification using statistical measures and domain-specific knowledge.

2. Adapt the threshold using domain-specific insights to improve performance.
3. Consider incorporating 2 standard deviations for a more robust sparsification.
1. Avoid unnecessary intermediate variables.
2. Update the array in place rather than creating a new one.
- Normalize distance matrix before applying heuristics.
