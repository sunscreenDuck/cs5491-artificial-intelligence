In this improved version `select_next_node_v2`, I added a look-ahead mechanism to consider future steps while selecting the next node. The function now explores several steps ahead to evaluate the scores of candidate nodes. The maximum number of look-ahead steps is set as three in the above code but it can be adjusted as per requirements. The look-ahead mechanism calculates the sum of scores obtained from the potential next nodes at each step, and this value is multiplied by a threshold parameter before being added to the overall score of a node. The next node to visit is then selected based on the highest score.
