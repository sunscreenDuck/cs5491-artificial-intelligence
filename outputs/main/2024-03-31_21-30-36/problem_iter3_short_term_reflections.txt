1. Reduce complexity by removing unnecessary variables and calculations.
2. Simplify the objective function by removing irrelevant terms.
3. Focus on the main components that directly impact the decision-making process.
1. Consider removing the look-ahead mechanism as it may not always improve the solution.
2. Simplify the score calculation and directly evaluate all unvisited nodes.
1. Consider incorporating a look-ahead mechanism to improve the quality of the selected next node.
2. Adjust the weights of the scoring components based on problem characteristics and experimentation.
1. Consider incorporating more factors into the scoring function for better decision making.
2. Utilize a look-ahead mechanism to consider the impact of potential future moves.
3. Gather statistics from multiple future steps and consider their average for better decision making.
1. Consider removing the look-ahead mechanism if the improvement in performance is not significant.
2. Simplify the scoring mechanism by removing unnecessary variables and terms.
3. Focus on improving the calculation of the average and standard deviation.
- Consider incorporating more lookahead steps to improve the accuracy of the heuristic.
- Fine-tune the weights for the different components of the scoring function.
- Explore different mechanisms to select the lookahead node, e.g., using a random selection strategy.
1. Simplify the code by avoiding unnecessary nested loops.
2. Consider all nodes instead of a limited set for better optimization results.
1. Incorporate multiple lookahead steps for better performance.
2. Consider additional factors such as average and standard deviation of distances.
3. Adjust weight parameters to balance the importance of different objective functions.
- Consider adding more parameters or metrics to the scoring function. 
- Implement multiple lookahead steps to better evaluate future node selections. 
- Use statistics (mean, standard deviation) to evaluate distances within subproblems.
1. Reduce the number of parameters and variables to simplify the heuristic.
2. Remove the look-ahead mechanism and threshold to improve the performance.
