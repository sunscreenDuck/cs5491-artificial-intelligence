- Use meaningful weights, simplify scoring function, and optimize computation.
- Consider ratios, selective incorporation, balance in scoring mechanism, and weighing factors.
- Simplify scoring, balance base and lookahead score, comprehensive metric, and introduce diversity.
- Add weight parameters, normalize distances, incorporate problem-specific knowledge, and enhance code readability.
- Experiment with coefficients, simplify logic, reduce calculations, and add conditions for better decision-making.
