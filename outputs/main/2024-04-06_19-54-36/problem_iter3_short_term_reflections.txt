- Simplify calculations.
- Avoid unnecessary normalization and weighting.
- Use matrix transpose for performance.
- Combine factors directly without intermediate steps.
1. Consider using more meaningful variable names for better code readability.
2. Revisit the use of average distance for edge importance calculation in the first code version.
3. Explore different sparsification thresholds for better pruning in the second code version.
1. Consider incorporating multiple factors that influence edge selection.
2. Ensure robustness by handling edge cases and avoiding division by zero.
3. Adjust the sparsification threshold to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
1. Consider incorporating both average and minimum distances for better heuristics.
2. Utilize sparsification based on combined factors to improve heuristics.
1. Consider using a combined factor that incorporates multiple heuristics.
2. Sparsify the matrix by setting a threshold based on the mean of the combined factors.
1. Consider combining factors from distance matrices rather than calculating inverse and summing separately.
2. Use a more meaningful threshold for sparsifying the matrix.
1. Exploit more informative features, such as local neighborhood information.
2. Consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge, e.g., node degree or clustering coefficients.
3. Explore different heuristics algorithms, such as ant colony optimization or simulated annealing.
4. Evaluate the performance of heuristics using benchmark instances and integrate cross-validation for robustness.
1. Normalize the distance matrix before using it in the heuristic.
2. Consider using other factors (e.g., local search, clustering) to improve the heuristics.
- Calculate inverse distances for better heuristics.
- Use sum of inverse distances to determine edge promisingness.
- Sparsify matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
- Consider multiple factors and weight them appropriately for better heuristics.
- Use sparsity to reduce complexity and focus on promising connections.
- Take into account inverse distance, inverse degree, and promising connections.
