In this `select_next_node_v2` function, we introduced a look-ahead mechanism to evaluate the potential next nodes. The look-ahead mechanism allows us to estimate the future performance by recursively calling the `select_next_node_v2` function for each potential node. The number of steps in the look-ahead process is controlled by the `look_ahead` parameter.

Note that the `select_next_node_v2` function assumes that the `select_next_node_v2` function is already defined. This allows us to recursively call the improved function to evaluate the potential future performance.
