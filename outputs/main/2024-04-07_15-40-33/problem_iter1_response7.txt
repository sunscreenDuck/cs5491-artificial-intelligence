```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # It's bad to include long edges in the solution, so we can normalize the distance matrix
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / distance_matrix.max()
    return normalized_distance_matrix
```
