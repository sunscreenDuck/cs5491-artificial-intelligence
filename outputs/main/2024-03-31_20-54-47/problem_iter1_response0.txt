In `select_next_node_v2`, I have added a look-ahead mechanism to enhance the selection of the next node. The look-ahead mechanism calculates a lookahead score for each possible next node and takes into account the potential impact on the overall solution. The lookahead scores are computed by evaluating the distance between the current node and the next node, as well as the average and standard deviation of distances between the next node and the remaining unvisited nodes. The lookahead score is then combined with the original scoring formula by introducing a threshold factor.
