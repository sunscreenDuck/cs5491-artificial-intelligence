1. Normalize distances before further calculations and utilize global statistics for normalization.
2. Use penalty matrix instead of edge indicators and update it incrementally to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. Optimize computation with vectorized operations and consider weighted average for node distances.
4. Minimize unnecessary calculations, loops, and iterations to improve overall performance.
