In the improved `select_next_node_v2` function, the look-ahead mechanism is added to consider the potential benefit of selecting each unvisited node. The function calculates the look-ahead score for each unvisited node by considering a subset of nodes from the unvisited set. The subset size is determined by the look_ahead parameter. Only the nodes with the highest scores are considered in the look-ahead mechanism to reduce computation time. The node with the highest lookahead score is selected as the next node to visit.
