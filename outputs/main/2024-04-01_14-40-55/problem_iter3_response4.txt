In this mutated function `select_next_node_v2`, the calculation of average and standard deviation of distances to unvisited nodes is moved outside the loop to reduce unnecessary calculations. The look-ahead mechanism is added to consider future choices, and the weight parameter is adjusted for more balanced importance of different factors. Additionally, a threshold is introduced to select the next node from the nodes with scores above the threshold. The code is optimized to minimize loops and iterations.
