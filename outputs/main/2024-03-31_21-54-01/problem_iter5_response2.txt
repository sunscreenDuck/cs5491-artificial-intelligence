```python
import numpy as np


def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    threshold = 0.7
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        all_distances = np.array([distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node])
        if len(all_distances) > 1:
            avg_distance_to_unvisited = np.average(all_distances)
            std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)
        else:
            avg_distance_to_unvisited = 0
            std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = 0
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * avg_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
I have made some changes in the code:

1. Added import statement: `import numpy as np` to import the numpy library.
2. Added condition to check if there are more than 1 unvisited nodes before computing the average and standard deviation distance. This avoids division by zero error.
3. Changed the variable name `average_distance_to_unvisited` to `avg_distance_to_unvisited` for consistency.
4. Handled the case when there is only one unvisited node, setting the average and standard deviation distances to 0 in that case.
