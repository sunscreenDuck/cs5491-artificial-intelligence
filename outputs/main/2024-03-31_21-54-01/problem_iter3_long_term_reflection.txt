1. Use a dynamic threshold based on problem characteristics and experiment with scoring mechanisms.
2. Prioritize exploration of promising options and simplify scoring function by removing unnecessary terms.
3. Analyze the impact of lookahead mechanism and optimize computation to improve overall performance.
