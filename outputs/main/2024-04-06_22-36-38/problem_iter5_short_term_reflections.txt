1. Normalize and calculate inverse distance matrix.
2. Set threshold based on mean of normalized inverse distance matrix.
3. Sparsify matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
- Normalize inverse distance matrix before applying sparsification.
- Use sum of inverse distance matrix for normalization rather than max distance.
- Adjust sparsification threshold for better edge selection.
1. Normalize distance matrix before taking the inverse.
2. Calculate threshold based on mean - std_dev instead of mean of the combined matrix.
3. Use normalized inverse distance matrix for sparsification.
1. Consider normalizing data before applying thresholding.
2. Use statistical measures like mean and standard deviation to determine threshold.
3. Preserve original normalized data and apply thresholding on a copy.
1. Avoid unnecessary normalization and use distances directly.
2. Use standard deviation for thresholding instead of the maximum value.
1. Normalize the distance matrix before calculating the inverse.
2. Use mean and standard deviation for threshold calculation when applying sparsification.
1. Normalize the distance matrix before further calculations.
2. Set the sparsification threshold based on the mean and standard deviation of the normalized inverse matrix.
1. Remove dynamic threshold calculation and set a fixed threshold for sparsification.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations such as mean and standard deviation of the inverse matrix.
Hints for designing better heuristics:
- Normalize distances before calculations.
- Consider mean and standard deviation when determining sparsification threshold.
- Use inverse of normalized matrix for better performance.
