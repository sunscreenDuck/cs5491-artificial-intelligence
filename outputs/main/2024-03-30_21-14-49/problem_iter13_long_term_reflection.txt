1. Simplify code logic, variable names, and calculations for better readability and maintainability.
2. Consider using normalized weights and meaningful scoring factors to improve decision-making.
3. Use efficient methods (e.g., min()) and vectorized operations for improved performance.
4. Remove random noise and unnecessary calculations to ensure determinism and simplicity.
