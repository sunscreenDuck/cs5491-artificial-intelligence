1. Utilize problem-specific knowledge and characteristics to simplify and improve the heuristic.
2. Balance the impact of different distances through more sophisticated normalization techniques or weighted penalization.
3. Consider incorporating distance matrix statistics to guide the heuristic calculations and prioritize edge selection.
