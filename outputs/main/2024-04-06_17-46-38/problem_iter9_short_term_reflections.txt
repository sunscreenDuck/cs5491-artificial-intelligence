1. Consider additional factors like standard deviation and pairwise differences of distances.
2. Normalize distance matrix before calculating average and standard deviation.
3. Use average distance to closest neighbors and maximum distance as factors.
4. Set unpromising elements to zero using an appropriate threshold value.
- Introduce domain knowledge and problem-specific factors.
- Consider non-linear and non-proportional relationships.
- Aim for a more sparse and focused heuristic matrix.
2nd code: Consider edge importance, relationship with other edges, and average pairwise difference in distances.

1st code: Consider edge importance and average distance, but avoid overcomplicating the heuristics with too many factors.
1. Eliminate zero division errors and consider non-zero elements for calculation.
2. Use nested loops and set the threshold based on the average distance for better performance.
- Consider using more meaningful factors for calculating the heuristics.
- Avoid overly complicated calculations that do not have a clear impact on the heuristics.
- Experiment with different combinations of factors and their weights.
- Set a more appropriate threshold for identifying unpromising elements.
1. Use element-wise operations on arrays instead of nested loops for efficiency.
2. Consider including more relevant factors and removing redundant calculations.
3. Normalize distances based on the average and standard deviation to maintain consistency.
4. Balance the weight/importance of each factor and adapt to specific problem instances.
1. Normalize distances properly to obtain meaningful results.
2. Consider using a combination of average, standard deviation, and pairwise difference of distances.
3. Include factors such as average/min/max distances to improve heuristics accuracy.
4. Choose appropriate thresholds to determine promising edges.
1. Normalize only once for better performance.
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and operations for efficiency.
3. Iterate over the distance matrix directly instead of using vectorized operations.
4. Update the heuristics values in-place instead of creating a new array.
5. Use logical indexing for setting unpromising elements to zero.
1. Normalize the data to improve the performance of the heuristics.
2. Simplify the calculation by removing unnecessary terms and factors.
3. Use nested loops to calculate the heuristics iteratively.
4. Adjust the threshold for zeroing out unpromising elements based on the problem characteristics.
1. Consider incorporating factors that capture the distribution and range of distances.
2. Utilize multiple factors that capture different aspects of the problem.
3. Normalize the distance matrix to ensure comparability of values.
4. Use statistics such as average, maximum, and standard deviation to capture different characteristics of the problem.
