```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    lookahead = 2  # Number of nodes to consider ahead
    threshold = 0.7
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        lookahead_nodes = list(unvisited_nodes - {node})[:lookahead]  # Nodes to consider ahead
        all_distances = [distance_matrix[node][i] for i in lookahead_nodes]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(all_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
In `select_next_node_v2`, I have added a lookahead mechanism to consider the distances to a certain number of nodes ahead. This allows us to get a better estimate of the future path choices and make a more informed decision on the next node to select.
