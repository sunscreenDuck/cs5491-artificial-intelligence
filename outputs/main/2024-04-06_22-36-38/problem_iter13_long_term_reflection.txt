1. Utilize domain-specific knowledge for sparsification threshold and threshold adaptation for improved performance.
2. Avoid redundant calculations and unnecessary intermediate variables to simplify code and increase efficiency.
3. Normalize distance matrix before applying calculations and consider statistical measures for threshold determination.
