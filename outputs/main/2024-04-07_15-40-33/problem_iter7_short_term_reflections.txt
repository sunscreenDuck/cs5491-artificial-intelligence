1. Use the maximum value to normalize the distance matrix (Better code). 
2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and indexing (Better code).
1. Normalize the distance matrix before subtracting the minimum values.
2. Avoid unnecessary copying of the distance matrix before normalizing and subtracting minimum values.
1. Normalize distance matrix before subtracting row and column minimums.
2. Compute row and column minimums from the original distance matrix, not the normalized one.
1. Avoid unnecessary copying and computations. 
2. Minimize matrix calculations to improve efficiency. 
3. Normalize distance matrix using maximum value directly. 
4. Subtract minimum values from each row and column in one step.
- Avoid creating unnecessary copies of data.
- Perform operations directly on the normalized matrix.
- Calculate row and column minimums separately to reduce computation.
- Use vectorized operations instead of element-wise operations.
1. Avoid subtracting minimum values twice (Worse code).
2. Normalize input before manipulating values (Better code).
1. Normalize the distance matrix to enhance comparability among edges.
2. Deduct the minimum values from both rows and columns for each element, based on the normalized matrix.
Use the minimum values on the rows and columns to normalize before subtracting; minimize dependencies.
Hints for designing better heuristics:
1. Normalize the input matrix.
2. Subtract minimum value separately for rows and columns.
Better heuristics: Normalize matrix, calculate row and column minimums, subtract from each row and column.
