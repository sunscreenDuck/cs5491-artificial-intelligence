1. Normalize based on max distance before subtracting minimum values.
2. Avoid redundant calculations by assigning minimum row and column values separately.
1. Avoid unnecessary computations and operations.
2. Normalize matrix before modifying it to ensure consistent scaling.
Normalize distance matrix before computing heuristics. Subtract minimum values from rows and columns.
1. Normalize distances before applying the heuristics.
2. Subtract row and column minimum values directly from the distance matrix (in-place).


1. Normalize distance matrix before operations.
2. Create a copy of the distance matrix to avoid changing the original values.
3. Subtract minimum row and column values after normalization.
1. Avoid modifying input in place.
2. Minimize computation redundancy to improve efficiency.
1. Normalize the distance matrix to improve the performance of the heuristic function.
2. Subtract the minimum value separately from each row and column for better results.
1. Normalize matrix before subtracting minimum values for better results. 
2. Avoid duplicate calculations by normalizing distance matrix prior to subtractions.
1. Normalize and center the distance matrix before applying other operations.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each row and column for better results.
- Avoid repeated calculations.
- Use intermediate variables to store results and reuse them.
