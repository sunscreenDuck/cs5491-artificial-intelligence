In the improved `select_next_node_v2` function, we introduce a look-ahead mechanism. For each unvisited node, we calculate a look-ahead score by calculating the average score from considering each possible next node. This look-ahead score is then added to the regular score calculation. The weight of the look-ahead score is controlled by the `threshold` parameter. This mechanism allows the algorithm to consider the potential future benefits of selecting a particular node.
