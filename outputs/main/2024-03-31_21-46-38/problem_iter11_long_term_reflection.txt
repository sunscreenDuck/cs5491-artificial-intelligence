1. Simplify scoring function, adjust weights, and avoid redundant calculations for efficiency and interpretability.
2. Use meaningful variable names, numpy functions, and set operations to optimize code clarity and performance.
3. Consider problem-specific insights, factors, and constraints for improved heuristics.
