[Reflection]
1. Used a min-heap data structure to efficiently retrieve the node with the highest score.
2. Removed the fixed threshold and made it a tunable parameter.
3. Incorporated additional factors (node degree or adjacency) into the heuristic.
4. Improved efficiency by prioritizing and exploring promising options early using a min-heap.
5. The function `select_next_node_v2` incorporates these improvements to solve the TSP more effectively compared to the previous versions.
