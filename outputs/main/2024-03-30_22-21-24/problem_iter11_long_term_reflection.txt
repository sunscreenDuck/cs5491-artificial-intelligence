1. Normalize weights for better distribution and control.
2. Use efficient operations like numpy functions.
3. Consider distance from current node to unvisited nodes.
4. Experiment with different weight combinations for optimal balance.
5. Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
6. Avoid unnecessary calculations to optimize performance.
