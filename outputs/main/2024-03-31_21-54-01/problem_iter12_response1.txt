[Reflection]
- The improved code avoids unnecessary calculations by calculating the average distance and standard deviation only once for each node.
- It uses variables `min_score` and `min_score_node` to track the minimum score and corresponding node, avoiding the need to use an additional `min()` function call outside the loop.
- The code is made more readable by using meaningful variable names and comments.
