```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    min_row = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    min_col = np.min(distance_matrix, axis=0)
    
    heuristics = distance_matrix / max_distance
    heuristics -= min_row[:, np.newaxis]
    heuristics -= min_col
    
    return heuristics
```
The changes made in `heuristics_v2` compared to `heuristics_v1` are as follows:
1. Removed unnecessary copy of the distance matrix as it was not used.
2. Moved the normalization and subtraction of minimum value calculations to the beginning of the function for better efficiency.
3. Renamed the variable name `normalized_matrix` to `heuristics` for better readability.
