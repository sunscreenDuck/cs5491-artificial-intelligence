System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a select_next_node function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
The select_next_node function takes as input the current node, the destination_node, a set of unvisited nodes, and a distance matrix, and returns the next node to visit.


def select_next_node_v1(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    threshold = 0.7
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        all_distances = [distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(all_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node


Improve `select_next_node_v1` to give `select_next_node_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

- Try look-ahead mechanisms.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to give hints to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two select_next_node functions for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
The select_next_node function takes as input the current node, the destination_node, a set of unvisited nodes, and a distance matrix, and returns the next node to visit.


You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Reflection]
1. Consider using a simpler scoring formula without unnecessary terms.
2. Remove the look-ahead mechanism, if it doesn't significantly improve the solution quality.
3. Use more descriptive variable names for better readability and maintainability.
4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and iterations over the unvisited nodes.
5. Evaluate the performance difference between different versions of the code.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `select_next_node_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

[2024-03-31 21:46:15,953][root][INFO] - Long-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to give hints to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
- Try look-ahead mechanisms.

Below are some newly gained insights.
1. Consider using a simpler scoring formula without unnecessary terms.
2. Remove the look-ahead mechanism, if it doesn't significantly improve the solution quality.
3. Use more descriptive variable names for better readability and maintainability.
4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and iterations over the unvisited nodes.
5. Evaluate the performance difference between different versions of the code.
1. Consider including a look-ahead mechanism to evaluate the potential future impact of selecting each node.
2. Use a subset of nodes with the lowest distances for look-ahead evaluation, to reduce computation.
1. Consider removing look-ahead mechanisms and focusing on immediate node evaluation.
2. Simplify the calculations by removing unnecessary variables and computations.
1. Avoid unnecessary computations in the heuristic function.
2. Simplify the selection process by directly selecting the node with the highest score.
3. Consider the trade-off between complexity and performance when adding look-ahead mechanisms.
1. Avoid unnecessary computations and look-ahead mechanisms.
2. Simplify the scoring criteria and selection process.
1. Include look-ahead mechanisms to evaluate the future impact of selecting a node.
2. Consider the average distance to unvisited nodes and the standard deviation of distances.
3. Balance the importance of different factors using appropriate coefficients.
4. Consider a subset of nodes for look-ahead rather than all unvisited nodes.
1. Simplify look-ahead mechanisms for better performance.
2. Remove unnecessary computations and sorting to improve efficiency.
- Avoid unnecessary computations and copying of data.
- Simplify the scoring function by removing look-ahead mechanisms.
- Consider using different parameter values to improve performance.
1. Consider removing unnecessary calculations (e.g., look-ahead mechanisms) that don't significantly improve the solution quality.
2. Simplify the scoring function by removing unused terms (e.g., average_distance_look_ahead).
3. Evaluate the impact of changing the coefficient values to find an optimal balance.
1. Consider simplified score calculation and avoid unnecessary iterations.
2. Remove look-ahead mechanism and avoid unnecessary computations.

[2024-03-31 21:46:19,314][root][INFO] - Mutation Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a select_next_node function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with constructive heuristics. TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.
The select_next_node function takes as input the current node, the destination_node, a set of unvisited nodes, and a distance matrix, and returns the next node to visit.



[Prior reflection]
1. Simplify scoring formula and remove unnecessary terms.
2. Evaluate and remove ineffective look-ahead mechanisms.
3. Use descriptive variable names for readability.
4. Avoid unnecessary calculations and iterations over unvisited nodes.
5. Compare performance of different versions of the code.- Try look-ahead mechanisms.

[Code]
def select_next_node_v1(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    threshold = 0.7
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        all_distances = [distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(all_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(all_distances)
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `select_next_node_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
