```python
def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - {node})]
        average_distance_to_unvisited = np.mean(unvisited_distances)
        std_dev_distance_to_unvisited = np.std(unvisited_distances)
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * average_distance_to_unvisited + c3 * std_dev_distance_to_unvisited - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
In the improved code, I made the following changes:
1. Removed the threshold variable as it was not being used.
2. Removed the redundant initialization of scores as an empty dict was sufficient.
3. Utilized set operations (set difference) to avoid redundant calculations of distances.
4. Changed the indexing of the distance matrix to use numpy array indexing for improved performance.
5. Removed the unnecessary calculation of average and standard deviation for select_next_node_v1.
 
These changes simplify the code, utilize set operations efficiently, and avoid redundant calculations, leading to improved performance.
