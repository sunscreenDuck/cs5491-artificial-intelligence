```python
def select_next_node_v2(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes."""
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        score = c1 * distance_matrix[current_node][node] - c2 * np.mean([distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node]) + c3 * np.std([distance_matrix[node][i] for i in unvisited_nodes if i != node]) - c4 * distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        scores[node] = score
    next_node = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return next_node
```
The `select_next_node_v2` function is an improved version that simplifies the code structure by removing unnecessary intermediate variables. It avoids calculating the average and standard deviation of lookahead distances since they are not utilized in the final score calculation.
